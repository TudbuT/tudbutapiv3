<h1>Explaination of GameAuth</h1>

<h2>What it is</h2>
GameAuth is a service with which the API can make sure you're really who you tell it
you are.

<h2>What it is not</h2>
GameAuth does not send your token to my API or anywhere it isn't supposed to be. The 
only place it ends up in is Mojang's session server.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Client sends the token to Mojang, telling Mojang that it wants to join a 
        Minecraft server with it</li>
    <li>Client tells my API that it has completed the previous step</li>
    <li>My API asks Mojang if the client has successfully "joined the server" 
        (despite the server not existing, Mojang is still able to verify a login attempt 
        to it)</li>
    <li>Mojang responds yes or no. If it responds yes, the GameAuth was successful.</li>
</ul>

Minecraft servers use a server ID to ask Mojang is a player has joined. This server ID 
can be anything, but real Minecraft server will always have them be an SHA1 hash of the
server IP and some other factors like the server's public-key. The Mojang API, however,
never checks if this Minecraft server is actually a real server. Because of this, I can
make the Minecraft client tell Mojang that it is currently trying to connect to a 
(fictional, non-existent) server (with an invalid server ID to not conflict with any 
real servers). My API then checks with Mojang if the client has joined this fictional 
server. This means the token is only ever sent to Mojang, just like when joining a 
Minecraft server.
