        <br/>

        The TudbuT API has existed for quite a while now, and its current version is...
        less than ideal. It's hard to maintain (giant switch statements are what routes
        traffic), the database is old and could use a revamp, the UserRecord model bugs 
        out when the user uses multiple things at once.
        <br>

        <center><h2>Let's fix that.</h2></center>

        The third iteration of my API is running on Tryumph, a robust HTTP server written
        in Java, able to route traffic using an annotation-based event distrubution 
        system, and with numerous parsers built right into the server.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, it can detect:<br>
        <div class="indent">
            <b>Your browser's fingerprint:</b>
            <div id="fingerprint"></div>
        </div>
        right on the server side, and without any JavaScript required. It can also 
        modify the HTML being sent on-the-fly, and inject mobile-compatibility code.
        <br>
        <br>
        The API is also using an entirely new data model: A UserRecord points to multiple
        ServiceRecords which link to their ServiceData, which is data about what the 
        service is, how many people use it, etc.<br>
        There will be a Discord service aswell, so users can link their Discord account.
        Because of this, I could make a Discord bot that tells people how much playtime 
        they have, and other statistics.

        <center><h2>Getting to the point</h2></center>
        The API has been completely remade, now with support for multiple services, so
        other clients by myself and others can use the API aswell. It's also much
        cleaner code, meaning I'll be able to add features much more easily.

                            a service. If so, you will receive a key with which you can manage the service. <b>Coding knowledge required</b> because
