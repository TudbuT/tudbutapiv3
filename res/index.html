            The TudbuT API has existed for quite a while now, and its current version is...
            less than ideal. It's hard to maintain (giant switch statements are what routes
            traffic), the database is old and could use a revamp, the UserRecord model bugs 
            out when the user uses multiple things at once.

            The third iteration of my API is running on Tryumph, a robust HTTP server written
            in Java, able to route traffic using an annotation-based event distrubution system,
            and with numerous parsers built right into the server.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, it can detect:<br>
            <div class="indent">
                <b>Your browser's fingerprint:</b>
                <div id="fingerprint"></div>
            </div>
            right on the server side, and without any JavaScript required. It can also modify
            the HTML being sent on-the-fly, and inject mobile-compatibility code (try it out!)

            <center><h2>Getting to the point</h2></center>
            The API has been completely remade, now with support for multiple services, so
            other clients by myself and others can use the API aswell. It's also much
            cleaner code, meaning I'll be able to add features much more easily.
